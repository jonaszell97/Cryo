# Cryo

Cryo is a persistence library for Swift apps. Out-of-the-box, it supports persistence with UserDefaults, NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore, Documents, and CloudKit.

Custom adaptors for other persistence backends can be defined by conforming to either the `CryoAdaptor` or `CryoDatabaseAdaptor` protocols.
