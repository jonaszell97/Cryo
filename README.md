# Cryo

Cryo is a persistence library for Swift apps. Out-of-the-box, it supports persistence with UserDefaults, NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore, Documents, and CloudKit.

Custom adaptors for other persistence backends can be defined by conforming to the `CryoAdaptor` protocol. 

## Documentation

Cryo is still in a pre-release alpha. Documentation will be added once the API stabilizes.
